OK, so you have set up your business website. You have hired an established firm and spend money to implement it. Taking that leap of faith heeding the advice of the business gurus was not easy, but you did it anyway. Now is the time for the customers to rush in and check out what your company has to offer.

But even after a few weeks, you find that the traffic to your site is not picking up. You have a growing feeling that you have made a dead investment. Within a month, your hopes that the new vista through which you can attract new clients are shattered.

But this does not have to be the case. What you are missing is some subtle tricks that will improve the ranking of your website. If followed strictly, these techniques will drive in more traffic and will translate to better business.

Techniques to Drive in More Traffic

### Increase the loading speed
Ticking clock is the greatest enemy when it comes to loading the website. It is quite annoying for everyone when a website takes a long time to load. Statistics prove that almost half of the people hit the back button when a particular site takes more than 10 seconds to load.

### Mobile-friendliness is crucial
With an increased number of people browsing through their mobile phones, Google has announced its mobile-first indexing strategy in 2019. If your site is not mobile-friendly, the traffic to the site can be negatively affected.

### Provide the right information at the right place
Many websites make the mistake of not giving enough information, including the product description, buying options and contact details. You should make sure that your business website has relevant data on all pages. Making navigation easy can improve customer satisfaction and prompt them to visit the site in the future.

### Listen to your customers
You should make an effort to communicate with your customers and respond to their grievances. Your website should include a comment section for this purpose. The newest technologies like Interactive AI can be added to provide an immediate response to the visitor.

### Keep it Simple
Make sure that your website has a simple design. Bombarding the customer with unnecessary information will do more harm than good. The navigation menu should be effective and easy to navigate. Avoid unwanted technical jargon that can bump off potential customers. Remember, your aim to attract customers, not impress them.

### Conclusion
So you have understood the 5 simple but effective tricks to improve the traffic to your business website. These simple techniques can indeed drive in more traffic. You should also make sure you provide quality products and services and convey that effectively to your customers. The traffic will then translate to improved business.

These tried and tested methods will help your website to improve its ranking too. With better business and more clients, the decision you made to start the website may even be the best move you have ever made.
